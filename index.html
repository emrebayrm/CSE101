    	<td> <h1 align="left" style="font-size:30px" >AFTER APPLE </h1>
        <p>		Wozniak thought computer classes in elementary schools. Because he knows that how could teachers effect on students’ lives. So that he did. And then in 2001 he founded Wheels of Zeus (WoZ), in this company he aimed to develop inventing new electronics with ambitious engineers like him especially wireless GPS technology. This company closed in 2006. After that he found one more technology company in 2006. This company attended technology competition named FIRST. After that he started to give many speeches and attend many exhibition and University conferences. At last He started to give classes in Sydney, Australia at University of Technology. </p>
        <h1> SOME CONTURBUTIONS </h1>
        <p>		First of all, he and Jobs create Apple Inc. with this company they gave very important development to technology. When they were creating the Apple computers, he invented PAL colour display method. And here is some patents;

<li>	Controller for magnetic disks recorders etc. </li>
<li>	Video display on Microcomputers</li>
<li> 	Digitally controlled color signal generation means for use with display </li>
<p>		But I think his lessons, speeches and conferences to new engineers and people who interested in technology, is more important he gave morale to new generations as you see in figure 1.</p>
